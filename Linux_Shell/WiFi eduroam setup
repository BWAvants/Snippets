First, run the following command with the user's password to generate a hash (not particualrly secure, but better than plain text):
        echo -n plaintext_password_here | iconv -t utf16le | openssl md4

Copy the string following "(stdin)= ", which will be called HASH below

In /etc/wpa_supplicant/wpa_supplicant.conf add this after any preferred networks and before any less desired networks:

REPLACE the identity and password with your info, including pasting the copied string in the place of HASH

network={
        ssid="eduroam"
        scan_ssid=1
        key_mgmt=WPA-EAP
        eap=PEAP
        identity="user@school.edu"
        password=hash:HASH
        phase1="peaplabel=0"
        phase2="auth=MSCHAPV2"
}

run the following commnd or reboot to take effect:
        wpa_cli -i wlan0 reconfigure
